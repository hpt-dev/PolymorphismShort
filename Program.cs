// Beggining
// Polymorphim is a pilar of OOP which means 'many forms'
// and it is used to describe the ability to provide differing functionality
// while sharing a common interface.


// Here we have two different implementations of the GetArea method which share a common interface,
// in the abstract class shape.
// overriding is also called runtime polymorphism,
// as we cannot determine whic implementation is being received at compile time.

// for example this method accepts the Shape object,
// and whether this method will get passed a circle or a square 
// depends on the logic of our code which isn't know until the logic is executed at runtime

// another type of polymorphism is method overloading, where we have a share method, 
// that can accept varying type or number of parameters and each has a different implementation
// Also called Compile Time polymorphism as the compiler knows which of the version to use at compile time
// based on the number of parameters



// End
// While polymorpihm is often discussed in the context of OOP, it actually doesn't have to involved
